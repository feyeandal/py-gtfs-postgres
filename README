Uses sample data from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), downloaded on 1-30-2011.  Code should be modified for other database, sets of data.

Make sure pg is installed for python

cccta=# create schema gtfs;
CREATE SCHEMA
cccta=# create user gtfs superuser;
CREATE ROLE
cccta=#

Update load-gtfs.py to agency name that matches the folder with the GTFS files in it - this will also be used as the agency ID

Mapnik:
select distinct _agency_id||coalesce(agency.agency_name,'')||b.description from routes join route_types b using (route_type) join agency using (_agency_id,agency_id);
